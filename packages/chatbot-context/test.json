Blocks are listed with all the necessary details. To make finding\nblocks easier,\n\n * Search - You can search for different blocks that cater to your needs by entering keywords in the search bar, as shown in the\n   above picture.\n * Filter - You can filter the registry for blocks by the following conditions: Appblocks version, Language/Frameworks, Block\n   Type, Visibility, Depedencies, Category\n\n\nVISITING AND USING A BLOCK\n\nWhen you click any Block in the registry, you are redirected to the Block Details page. It gives you all details about the\nparticular block. There will be ReadMe, Versions, Block Dependencies, Composable Blocks and Variants. On the right side, you can\nsee installation instructions. Copy and paste the bb-cli command in the CLI and use the block right away. You can also find the\nnumber of downloads, tags, version and other such useful information about the Block.\n\nimage [https://github.com/appblocks-hub/docs/assets/33730398/566aa853-8cf3-4e65-9874-aaf3c976e5ec]\n\nREADME\n\nThe ReadMe tab contains general information about this particular block. It may consist of pictures and videos with documentation.\n\nVERSIONS\n\nThe Versions tab will display all versions of the Block till date.\n\nVARIANTS\n\nThe same block with slight alterations or customizations.\n\nMEMBER BLOCKS\n\nThese are child blocks that come inside a package block.\n\nEdit this page [https://github.com/appblocks-hub/docs/tree/main/docs/Platform Features/blocks-store/walkthrough.md]\n\nPrevious\n@appblocks/node-sdk\n[/docs/SDK/node-sdk]\nNext\nLicenses\n[/docs/Platform Features/Publish and Download/License for free blocks]\n * Registry\n * Visiting and using a block","metadata":{"source":"https://docs.appblocks.com/docs/Platform%20Features/blocks-store/walkthrough","title":"Registry Overview | Appblocks Developer Docs","description":"Registry","language":"en"}},{"pageContent":"Skip to main content\nAppblocks Logo [/img/logo.svg]Appblocks Logo [/img/logo.svg]\n/\nRegistry [https://registry.appblocks.com/]Discord [https://discord.gg/2xn3BPa7EV]GitHub [https://github.com/appblocks-hub]\n\n * Why Appblocks?

While using appblocks, we always recommend\ncreating and reusing blocks which are battle-tested components. For running tests, we have the bb run-test command in bb-cli. It\nsearches for all the files with .test.js or .spec.js extension or in the ___tests___ folder inside each qualifying block inside\nthe root package block and runs the tests. Use the bb run-test --help flag for more documentation on the command.\n\n\nTESTING SETUP\n\nThe blocks come bundled with Jest and the test script. Jest [https://jestjs.io/] is a JavaScript test runner that provides\nresources for writing and running tests. The UI blocks come with React Testing Library included. React Testing Library\n[https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/] offers a set of testing helpers that structure your tests based on\nuser interactions rather than components’ implementation details. Jest is used as the test runner, and React Testing Library\nprovides test helpers for structuring tests around user interactions.\n\nThe test setup can be configured to desired preference by use of config files. It is advised to install all the packages before\nrunning the tests.\n\n\nADDING THE TESTS\n\n\nUNIT TESTS\n\nUnit testing is a way to test small pieces of code. The unit under test (UUT) is usually an individual function or method in your\napplication\n\n * If Jest is not configured in a block. Install Jest using the command.\n   \n     npm i -D jest\n   \n   \n   Copy\n\n * Add the following section to your package.json:\n   \n     {\n         \"scripts\": {\n         \"test\": \"jest\"\n         }\n     }\n   \n   \n   Copy\n\n * Create files containg testing logic with .test.js or .spec.js extension along with the files you need to test or include them\n   in the ___tests___ folder. For e.g. /App.test.js\n   \n   import React from 'react'\n   import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react'\n   import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'\n   import App from './src/App'\n   \n   describe('App', () => {\n     it('renders without crashing', async () => {\n       render(\n         <BrowserRouter>\n           <App />\n         </BrowserRouter>\n       )\n       const appElement = screen.getByTestId('app')\n       await waitFor(() => expect(appElement).toBeInTheDocument())\n     })\n   })\n   \n   \n   Copy\n\n * Run the following command in bb-bli\n   \n     bb run-test\n   \n   \n   Copy\n\nEdit this page [https://github.com/appblocks-hub/docs/tree/main/docs/testing.mdx]\n\nPrevious\nSpaces\n[/docs/Platform Features/Spaces]\n\n * Introduction\n * Testing Setup\n * Adding the tests\n   * Unit Tests","metadata":{"source":"https://docs.appblocks.com/docs/testing","title":"Testing | Appblocks Developer Docs","description":"Introduction","language":"en"}},{"pageContent":"{\"payload\":{\"allShortcutsEnabled\":false,\"fileTree\":{\"docs\":{\"items\":[{\"name\":\"CLI\",\"path\":\"docs/CLI\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\"Platform\nFeatures\",\"path\":\"docs/Platform\nFeatures\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\"SDK\",\"path\":\"docs/SDK\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\"core-concepts\",\"path\":\"docs/core-concepts\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\"quickstart\",\"path\":\"docs/quickstart\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\"intro.mdx\",\"path\":\"docs/intro.mdx\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"testing.mdx\",\"path\":\"docs/testing.mdx\",\"contentType\":\"file\"}],\"totalCount\":7},\"\":{\"items\":[{\"name\":\".docusaurus\",\"path\":\".docusaurus\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\"docs\",\"path\":\"docs\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\"src\",\"path\":\"src\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\"static\",\"path\":\"static\",\"contentType\":\"directory\"},{\"name\":\".DS_Store\",\"path\":\".DS_Store\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\".gitignore\",\"path\":\".gitignore\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"LICENSE\",\"path\":\"LICENSE\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"README.md\",\"path\":\"README.md\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"amplify.yml\",\"path\":\"amplify.yml\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"babel.config.js\",\"path\":\"babel.config.js\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"docusaurus.config.js\",\"path\":\"docusaurus.config.js\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"package-lock.json\",\"path\":\"package-lock.json\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"package.json\",\"path\":\"package.json\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"sidebars.js\",\"path\":\"sidebars.js\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"tailwind.config.js\",\"path\":\"tailwind.config.js\",\"contentType\":\"file\"},{\"name\":\"yarn.lock\",\"path\":\"yarn.lock\",\"contentType\":\"file\"}],\"totalCount\":16}},\"fileTreeProcessingTime\":9.259941000000001,\"foldersToFetch\":[],\"repo\":{\"id\":498218883,\"defaultBranch\":\"main\",\"name\":\"docs\",\"ownerLogin\":\"appblocks-hub\",\"currentUserCanPush\":false,\"isFork\":false,\"isEmpty\":false,\"createdAt\":\"2022-05-31T06:47:36.000Z\",\"ownerAvatar\":\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109507147?v=4\",\"public\":true,\"private\":false,\"isOrgOwned\":true},\"symbolsExpanded\":false,\"treeExpanded\":true,\"refInfo\":{\"name\":\"main\",\"listCacheKey\":\"v0:1700737185.0\",\"canEdit\":false,\"refType\":\"branch\",\"currentOid\":\"0ca958cfba5e361ef21ef6095dbf1e8d0d9c448b\"},\"path\":\"docs/intro.mdx\",\"currentUser\":null,\"blob\":{\"rawLines\":[\"---\",\"title:\nWhy Appblocks?\",\"sidebar_position: 1\",\"sidebar_class_name: \\\"side-menu-why-appblocks\\\"\",\"---\",\"\",\"## Motivation\",\"\",\"“Not all Apps\nrequire re-engineering.
